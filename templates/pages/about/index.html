    <h5>We mentor.</h5>
    <p>We have a tiered system of mentoring opportunities. Senior Mentors write material and provide tips to Junior Mentors on how to teach. All mentors meet up once a week to learn from each other, and meet up another time to teach a section. Our Associate Mentors are either tutors, readers, or other experienced teachers who teach a section without guidance.</p>
