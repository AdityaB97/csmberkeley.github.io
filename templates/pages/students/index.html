    <h5>FAQ</h5>

    <h6>The deadline to sign up has already passed, can I still sign up?</h6>
    <p>Yes. CSM's biggest priority is reaching out to as many students as we can. However, if you aren't enrolled on Telebears, you will still be required to regularly attend the specific section you are assigned to.</p>

    <h6>Can I get units for attending a section?</h6>
    <p>Yes! Each student can receive 1 unit of P/NP credit. We will provide you the appropriate CCN when the time comes. You are not required to enroll. You must attend 90% of assigned weekly sessions in order to pass.</p>

    <h6>Who can I contact if I have more questions?</h6>
    <p>Feel free to email us at <a href="MAILTO:csmberkeley@gmail.com">csmberkeley@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns!</p>
